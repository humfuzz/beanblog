      <description>On the second weekend of every year, I set aside my entire life for a singular activity—the MIT Mystery Hunt. The problem with ignoring life, sleep, for the monolithic goal of solving a million puzzles, is that you also ignore whatever habits you’ve just tried to start in the new year.
Case in point: it’s been three weeks since my first “weekly” post. It’s a perfect setup for failure!
In 2020, I wanted to review my Russian Anki deck (flash cards for learning new vocabulary) every day.</description>

      <description>In 2021, I bought a new keyboard for stenography. It wasn’t until a year later, when I committed to writing a daily diary with it, that I actually started learning steno. At the start of 2022, I set a simple, achievable goal: write 20 words every day.
We’ll come back to how well I kept that habit, but this year I’ve set a new goal: write 500 words each week, and publish it here, my new—hopefully lifelong—blog.</description>
